<p>There is a difference of amount claimed and admitted on account of the reasons:<br />
1. Receipts of payments are only for Rs. ... as such the total principal has not been admitted<br />
2. Please note that you have claimed the entire amount inclusive of service tax, kindly note that we can admit only the principal amount exclusive of service tax as service tax is the statutory liability of the Corporate Debtor as such there is a difference between the Principal amount claimed and Principal amount provisionally admitted.<br />
3. Further there is a difference in the interest claimed and admitted on account of the difference in principal amount provisionally admitted.</p>

<p>Kindly note that this is only a provisional admission of the claim and will undergo change(s) based on the further documents submitted by you or as available for the Corporate Debtor.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Your claim has been accepted/ admitted on provisional basis based on documents and information submitted by you. We have not yet received any data from the Corporate Debtor (SIPL) to enable us to cross verify the claims with the records and books of the Corporate Debtor. Hence this admitted amount may undergo change(s) after cross verification from the appropriate data available with me from corporate debtor or any alternate authentic source. In case you have any additional corroborative information/records same may please be furnished at the earliest.</p>
